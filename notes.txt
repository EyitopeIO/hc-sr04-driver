Rather than doing what turns out to be a rather dangerous "fixup" if
we see a file with a different path but the same inode as another file
we've previously seen, throw and abort. Direct the user to a wiki page
where we can maintain information about what this error means.

Driver crash because I didn't return a value on open()



"Attributes should be ASCII text files, preferably with only one value per file. It is noted that it may not be efficient to contain only one value per file, so it is socially acceptable to express an array of values of the same type."
